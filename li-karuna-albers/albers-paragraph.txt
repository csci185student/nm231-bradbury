I did the boundaries project. I wanted the divs to come together on the user’s click so that they can control the distance between the divs and see how the boundaries come together and how the colors that seemed the same are actually different. I was also curious to see at which distance apart the set of colors would start to appear different from one another. It turns out, they have to be quite close together in order to see the subtle difference in hues. There are soft boundaries between the similar hues and hard boundaries between different hues. For the how much to how much project, I chose tan and pink; two colors that are ugly when seen in equal proportions but seem less ugly when in different proportions. The color that is a smaller proportion looks like an accent. These rules of proportions can be used in the fashion industry to prevent color clash in outfits. For example, too much of two colors in a pants pattern could clash and prevent the eyes from finding a focal point. However, adjusting the ratios of the colors can give the pants a more solid identity. My idea for the free study was to compare the way our eyes conceive color and the way color is conveyed to us through screens. I chose the optical illusion “true cyan” and set an animation to make the screen change after 30 seconds to a div of “cyan”, as pre-built into the CSS code. If the user stares at the red circle for 30 seconds and then keeps their eyes positioned in the same location the red circle had been, the “true cyan” and “cyan” will partially overlap in the center. At this point, the user can compare the colors where they do not overlap, and see how the mixed colors create a darker, new color in the center.
