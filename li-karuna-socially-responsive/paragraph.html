                    I chose to do my project on screen addiction. These days, every app 
                    on the market is trying to hold our attention. I personally struggle 
                    with screen addiction, and I know many other people struggle with it too. 
                    This problem is an epidemic that we're not discussing because excessive
                    screen use has been normallized in today's society. While laptops and cellphones
                    are useful for accessing accurate information, some of the apps (such as instagram) 
                    have been known to cause body insecurities and eating disorders. Additionally, 
                    many people, myself included, suffer loss of sleep due to excessive screen usage.
                    Losing sleep can cause a person to suffer from consequential symptoms such as 
                    fatigue, depression, anxiety, and guilt. While I don't know how exactly the issue
                    should be solved, given our level of dependence on screens in our everday life, I
                    believe that screen addiction is an illness that should be taken more seriously by
                    health professionals.
