                    Keith Obadike's Blackness for Sale was an eBay page advertising the sale of his blackness. The creators use online sales channels to try to convey a message to American society, which is currently the main channel of the online economy, the online trading system.
                    “The Language of Absurdity” of Keith and Mendi Obadike's "Blackness for Sale". The absurd offers the opportunity to undermine the very forces of conformity that entrench such poverty, insecurity, and terror and enable us to circumvent the logic of domination by refusing to meet it on its own ground. Rather than maintaining the discourse of domination, the absurd reveals the illogics in that discourse to invite another kind of engagement.
                    'Blackness for Sale' is technically feasible and simple. For everyone at present, it is very simple, and users do not need to consider technical issues, abilities, etc. The emergence of "Blackness for Sale" is mainly to provide everyone with a new way of thinking and a new voice channel.
                    Artists are in the channels of online shopping. As long as' Blackness for Sale 'can reach the upper echelons of eBay, regardless of whether eBay removes the list of Obadiakes in the future, Obadiakes can assert their own thoughts:' Black people still have a disconnect from American society '.
                    Although I am not very familiar with Obadiakes' aesthetic choices, I am greatly shocked that Obadiakes actively created this artwork to achieve their own goals, and may have intended to popularize the artwork rather than specialize in aristocratic style. Obadikes uses humorous and absurd descriptions to promote and satirize American society in non mainstream ways.
                    Mendi Obadike and Keith Obadike are an Igbo Nigerian American couple who create music, writing, and art. Mendi is a poet and Keith is a composer and sound artist. In 1996 Mendi and Keith started making conceptual Internet art and sound art works together with the goal of creating Internet operas. They also created  SIMONE BROWNE’S TEXT  ，THE INTERACTION OF COLOREDS  .
