HTML and CSS Page Layout / Arranging Divs on a page using CSS:

1. CSS Box Model - positioning properties, 
floats to lay out divs / elements on a page

2. CSS Flexbox = model for arranging elements on a page that is dynamic and relational (parent/child).
    Parent - "flex-container".
    Child - "flex-item".

3. CSS Grid - dynamic model for arranging complex elements within a page. Based on column and row layouts - more complexity than flexbox.
